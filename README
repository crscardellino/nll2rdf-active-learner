Requirements:
------------
- Java JRE 1.7
- Unix OS (Linux or OSX): This program uses many scripts with access
  to many unix programs and functions and is not suitable for a
  Windows environment.
- Perl 5.18.4 or above with the following modules:
  - List::MoreUtils
  - String::Util

Perl:
----
For the perl version and the String module I advice the installation of
perlbrew and cpanm. Visit <http://perlbrew.pl/> for information on this
installation. You can follow the steps descriptive above, or you can run
`config.sh` to do it automatically (only tested on Linux, should also
work on OSX).

$ \curl -L http://install.perlbrew.pl | bash # Installation of perlbrew

After the installation add: `source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc`
to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file.

Install an available version of `perl-5.18` (for example perl-5.18.4) with:
`perlbrew install perl-5.18.4`.

When installation is complete, select the installed perl version with
`perlbrew use perl-5.18.4`.

Install cpanm with: `perlbrew install-cpanm`.

Install the modules: `cpanm List::MoreUtils String::Util`

Usage:
-----
To start the learning process give execution permissions to the "learner" file or use `perl learner`:

./learner -t <TAGGED_DIR> -u <UNTAGGED_DIR> -o <OUTPUT_DIR> [-q <NUMBER_OF_QUERIES>] [-f <FILTER_TAGGED_CORPUS>] [-g <FILTER_UNTAGGED_CORPUS>] [--passive]

Options:
-------
  -t <TAGGED_DIR>
    Required. TAGGED_DIR must be the path (absolute or relative) to the
    directory where the initial annotated corpus is stored in conll IOB format in
    the different subdirectories. The corpus can be obtained in the following
    link <http://www.cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~ccardellino/resources/licensescorpus/licenses_annotated.tar.bz2>.
    By decompressing the tar file, the needed directory is listed as:
    "licenses-conll-format".

  -u UNTAGGED_DIR
    Required. Directory containing the unannotated corpus, tagged in conll 
    format. The unannotated corpus can be obtained by following the link:
    <http://www.cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~ccardellino/resources/licensescorpus/licenses_unannotated_conll.tar.bz2>.
    The directory "conll-corpus" is the target directory.

  -o OUTPUT_DIR
    Required. Directory that will storage the data, results and models
    of each iteration. Should be an emtpy directory.

  -q NUMBER_OF_QUERIES
    Optional. A number indicating the number of queries the oracle will
    annotate manually in each iteration of the algorithm. If not provided
    it's default value is 5.

  -f FILTER_TAGGED_CORPUS
    Optional. A number that indicates a filter for the times a feature
    in the annotated corpus shall occur to be taken in consideration for
    building the model. If not provided it's default value is 0 (all
    features are considered).

  -g FILTER_UNTAGGED_CORPUS
    Optional. A number that indicates a filter for the times a feature
    shall occur in the unannotated corpus to be taken in consideration for
    building the unannotated corpus model. If not provided the default
    value is 10.
    NOTE: This number directly affect on the overall performance of the
    learner. The smaller it is, the slower the algorithm becomes. On
    bigger numbers, the performance improve but the queries are less
    useful. On initial experiments, a number between 10 and 20 is the
    best option.

  -passive
    Optional. A flag that, if present, will do a Passive Learning approach,
    that is, will randomly select the instances from the pool of unlabeled
    instances, instead of using Uncertainty Sampling to select the instances
    to annotate by the oracle.
