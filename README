Requirements:
------------
- Java JRE 1.7
- Perl 5.16.2 or above
- Unix OS (Linux or OSX): This program uses many scripts with access
	to many unix programs and functions and is not suitable for a
	Windows environment.

Usage:
-----
To start the learning process give execution permissions to the "learner" file or use: `perl learner`:

./learner -t <TAGGED_DIR> -u <UNTAGGED_DIR> -o <OUTPUT_DIR> [-q <NUMBER_OF_QUERIES>] [-f <FILTER_TAGGED_CORPUS>] [-g <FILTER_UNTAGGED_CORPUS>] [--passive]

Options:
-------
  -t <TAGGED_DIR>
		Required. TAGGED_DIR must be the path (absolute or relative) to the
		directory where the initial annotated corpus is stored in conll IOB format in
		the different subdirectories. The corpus can be obtained in the following
		link <http://www.cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~ccardellino/resources/licensescorpus/licenses_annotated.tar.bz2>.
		By decompressing the tar file, the needed directory is listed as:
		"licenses-conll-format".
  
	-u UNTAGGED_DIR
		Required. Directory containing the unannotated corpus, tagged in conll 
		format. The unannotated corpus can be obtained by following the link:
		<http://www.cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/~ccardellino/resources/licensescorpus/licenses_unannotated_conll.tar.bz2>.
		The directory "conll-corpus" is the target directory.
  
	-o OUTPUT_DIR
		Required. Directory that will storage the data, results and models
		of each iteration. Should be an emtpy directory.

  -q NUMBER_OF_QUERIES
		Optional. A number indicating the number of queries the oracle will
		annotate manually in each iteration of the algorithm. If not provided
		it's default value is 5.

  -f FILTER_TAGGED_CORPUS
		Optional. A number that indicates a filter for the times a feature
		in the annotated corpus shall occur to be taken in consideration for
		building the model. If not provided it's default value is 0 (all
		features are considered).

  -g FILTER_UNTAGGED_CORPUS
		Optional. A number that indicates a filter for the times a feature
		shall occur in the unannotated corpus to be taken in consideration for
		building the unannotated corpus model. If not provided the default
		value is 25.
		NOTE: This number directly affect on the overall performance of the
		learner. The smaller it is, the slower the algorithm becomes. On
		bigger numbers, the performance improve but the queries are less
		useful. Some initial experimentations reveal 25 is a good number.

  -passive
		Optional. A flag that, if present, will do a Passive Learning approach,
		that is, will randomly select the instances from the pool of unlabeled
		instances, instead of using Uncertainty Sampling to select the instances
		to annotate by the oracle.
